# Personal Website - Josh Fieldhouse

My personal website was produced using React with a minimalist UI design and animations. The website provides an about me section where my job history and web dev skills are displayed, provides links to Github code for each of my projects on display and a contact me section. The website can quickly be updated with new projects given the modular nature of the code design and is fully accessible on all devices and sizes.
